        <h2>What is CSS?</h2>
        <ol type="1" style="font-weight: bold;">
         <li>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets.</li><br>
         <li>CSS describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen,paper,or in other media.</li><br>
         <li><span style="text-decoration: line-through;">CSS not neccsary</span> <span style="background-color: yellow;">CSS saves a lot of work.</span>  It can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once</li><br>
         <li><i><span style="text-decoration: underline;">External stylessheets are stored in CSS files.</span></i></li><br>
        </ol>
        <h2>CSS can be added to HTML documents in 3 ways:</h2>
        <ul style="letter-spacing: 5px; font-weight: bold;">
            <li>Inline - by using the style attribute inside HTML elements</li>
            <li>Internal - by using a style elements in the head section</li>
            <li>External - by using a link elements to link to an external CSS file.</li>
            <li>The most common way to add CSS, is to keep the styles in external CSS files. However, <span style="background-color: yellow;">in this tutorials we will use inline and internal styles,</span> because this is easier to demonstrate, and easier for you to try it yourself.</li>
        </ul>
        <P>When comparing CSS class vs ID, the difference is that CSS class applies a style to multiple elements.ID, on the other hand, applies a style to one unique elements. ID is also special in that you can aspecial URL to link directly to an element and it's used by JavaScript.</P>
        <p>In CSS, selectors are used to terget a specific element or range of elements on a web page. once an elements has been targeted, a style or set of styles can be applied to the element.</p>
        <p>There is a wide range of selectors available. Two of the most commonly used are class and ID. Both are used to target elements to which a style should be applied.</p>
